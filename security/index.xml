Upgrade your base image Usually your best of upgrading the image you build FROM to the latest one available. Those are most likely to have their vulnerabilities addressed. And it likely does so in a smaller image.
However that's not always the case - that the latest versions have no vulnerabilities - or this forces you to simultaneously upgrade your programming language SDK which you might not want at this time or slows you down in addressing vulnerabilities in your already running containers.</description></item></channel></rss>
